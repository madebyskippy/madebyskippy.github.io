        A dynamic interactive comic game where you shape the comic through traditional paneling techniques. Each change you make to the format of the comic changes the character interactions and reveals more about their personalities.
        <br><br>
        We were interested in using the core elements of comics to create and interactive experience, something that couldn't exist outside of a comic form. We looked at a lot of games and comics and movies for reference, and in the end decided to focus on paneling as a mechanic. The player directly manipulates the shapes of the panels on the page in order to interact with the comic.
