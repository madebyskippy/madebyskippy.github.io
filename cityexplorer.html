        I was an Associate Developer at <a href="https://www.potiondesign.com/">Potion Design</a>, and covered a range of responsibilities, from concept to development to deployment. I worked closely with designers to build tools and implement different assets and animations, combining them with procedural movement to be responsive to user input. I built systems for interactive projection mapping and experimented with different physical controls.<br><br>Some of the projects I worked on are yet unreleased. Please contact me for more details.
        <br><br><br>
        One of the projects I worked on was the <a href="https://www.potiondesign.com/project/city_explorer/">City Explorer,</a> for the NYU Langone Hassenfeld Children's Hospital. It won the <a href="https://segd.org/city-explorer-hassenfeld-childrens-hospital">SEGD Honor Award</a> and the 
        <a href="https://designawards.core77.com/Interaction/84143/City-Explorer">Core77 Notable Interaction Award</a>.
        <br><br>
        City Explorer is a collection of NYC-themed gestural games for up to six people at a time. Each game is designed to last a short while and be easy to come in and out of, to accomodate different people's interests.
        <br><br>
        I developed several of the games, including a crowd favorite dancing costume game, a free flying game where you can soar around Manhattan with giant landmarks, and a set of skyline games where you can paint, knock around cloud animals, and set off fireworks.
