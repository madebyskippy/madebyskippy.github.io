            A game made in 14 weeks for the class CMS.617, Advanced Game Studio.<br><br>
            It is confirmed to work in Chrome.

            You are put in a world made completely of fibers. The world is amiss because of a feud between your two grandmothers, the ultimate creators, about which creation technique (crocheting or knitting) is the better method. It's up to you to manipulate the fibers around you to reconnect them, and demonstrate that crocheting and knitting can work together harmoniously.

            <div class="side">The Team:</div>
            <div class="content">Stephanie "Beep boop beep" Gu spends most of her time making water sound effects during playtests. She spends a little bit of time designing levels and squashing Ethan's desire to feature creep. <br><br>
                Ethan "Positivity-Man" Sherbondy spends most of his time debugging despite his passion for insects. When Stephanie gets scary, he tends to escape from the nearest window.<br><br>
                Turner "Champion Bug Fixer" Bohlen makes up a third of the team's tallest members. He is in constant battle with the every single one of the movable block bugs.<br><br>
                Daniel "You are wavering precariously" Martelly's favorite activity is giving Lili piggy back rides. His second favorite activity is probably refactoring code and putting menu buttons in the wrong spot.<br><br>
                Lili "Does anyone have chocolate" Sun can usually be found accidentally buying <strike>too much</strike> not enough yarn. When not creating game art, Lili is probably forgetting all the powers of 2.<br><br>
                Jeff "Leave me alone I have a thesis to do" Prouty crawled out of his hole and created all of the beautiful sounds that come from the game in just one day.<br><br>

            <h1>Alpha build</h1>
            4/15/2014<br><br>
            An early build of our game, with only one working level.<br>
            Many of the assets and player feedback were not in yet.<br><br>
            Instructions to play:<br><br>
            Press <i>P </i> a couple times to unpause the game and start playing.<br><br>
            Use arrow keys and space to jump.<br>
            Use <i>E</i> + up/down arrows over an item.<br>
            Use <i>R </i>to reset.<br>
            The goal is to jump off the other side of the level (into the abyss).<br><br>
