        At <a href="https://www.potiondesign.com/">Potion</a>, I worked on prototyping different physical interfaces and developing a system to use them. I used <a href="https://www.phidgets.com/">Phidgets</a> for electronics and built the physical prototypes. This prototype was then used to show clients a proof of concept in a different project.
        <br><br>
        For the prototype I created a tool in Unity to use multiple Phidgets and build up classes for each sensor. I made it easy for other scripts to access the methods and even trigger things within Unity without scripting necessary.
        <br><br>
        For video playback, I used HAP encoded video for smooth scrubbing. I built a system to make it easy to switch between videos and test different content, as well as adjust the speed of the scrubbing with the wheel. On top of that, with the HAP encoded video I was able to layer an alpha video on top, creating a sort of interaction between the two videos and two wheels. We tried lots of different content, from 360 turnarounds to create a "fake 3D" effect to timelapses.
